This is simply an exact duplicate of my existing website at http://www.bryan-taylor.com.

With minimal database interaction, I thought this would be a good starting point for my own independent app using Rails.

Obviously, the difference in the this and the original site, is that this one is running off of Rails, where as the current one is based on PHP.  If I can get this up and running, I will likely replace the PHP version.
